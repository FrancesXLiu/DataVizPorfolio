# [Title](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w8)
Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

The reason I chose this chart for critique is that it's easy to understand - the bar chart clearly shows the cost per 30 grams of protein in different foods. This is useful for the target audience - fitness enthusiasts, dietitians, and consumers on a budget who are conscious of eating healthy. The design of the chart is clean and simple, using bar charts, a common and intuitive way of presenting data so that readers can quickly grasp the cost of protein in various food products. 
<br />
However, this chart is still slightly flawed in some design elements, so there is room for improvement. I think this chart is an ideal candidate for redesign and optimisation, aiming to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of its messaging, while improving the consistency and professionalism of its visual presentation.


## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._
| Usefulness     	| 8  	|
| Completeness   	| 6  	|
| Perceptibility 	| 5  	|
| Truthfulness   	| 8  	|
| Intuitiveness  	| 10 	|
| Aesthetics     	| 8  	|
| Engagement     	| 7  	|
An overview of my reasons for scoring: firstly, the chart does a good job of showing the cost per 30g of protein in different food products, effectively conveying the cost information through a visual bar chart. In particular, the appropriate use of colour and layout makes the information easy to understand at a glance. This approach is ideal for fitness enthusiasts, dietitians and health-conscious consumers on a budget, who can quickly compare the cost-effectiveness of different foods to make more informed dietary choices.
<br />
However, the charts have some shortcomings in terms of completeness and perceptibility. For example, while the charts provide cost and calorie data, they lack information on currency units and data collection times-the price of a food is tied to the geographic location of purchase, and the time of data collection. In addition, certain design choices, such as the size and placement of food pictures, may interfere with the accurate reading of the data. The chart's Y-axis labels are placed vertically, requiring readers to tilt their heads in order to read them, and the placement of food names on the X-axis requires more visual movement on the part of the user; these design issues may reduce the chart's perceptual efficiency.


## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
