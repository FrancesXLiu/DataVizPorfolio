# Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

The reason I chose this chart for critique is that it's easy to understand - the bar chart clearly shows the cost per 30 grams of protein in different foods. This is useful for the target audience - fitness enthusiasts, dietitians, and consumers on a budget who are conscious of eating healthy. The design of the chart is clean and simple, using bar charts, a common and intuitive way of presenting data so that readers can quickly grasp the cost of protein in various food products. 
<br />
However, this chart is still slightly flawed in some design elements, so there is room for improvement. I think this chart is an ideal candidate for redesign and optimisation, aiming to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of its messaging, while improving the consistency and professionalism of its visual presentation.


## Step two: the critique
| Measure         |Score|
|-----------------|-----|
| Usefulness     	| 8  	|
| Completeness   	| 6  	|
| Perceptibility 	| 5  	|
| Truthfulness   	| 8  	|
| Intuitiveness  	| 10 	|
| Aesthetics     	| 8  	|
| Engagement     	| 7  	|

An overview of my reasons for scoring: firstly, the chart does a good job of showing the cost per 30g of protein in different food products, effectively conveying the cost information through a visual bar chart. In particular, the appropriate use of colour and layout makes the information easy to understand at a glance. This approach is ideal for fitness enthusiasts, dietitians and health-conscious consumers on a budget, who can quickly compare the cost-effectiveness of different foods to make more informed dietary choices.
<br />
However, the charts have some shortcomings in terms of completeness and perceptibility. For example, while the charts provide cost and calorie data, they lack information on currency units and data collection times-the price of a food is tied to the geographic location of purchase, and the time of data collection. In addition, certain design choices, such as the size and placement of food pictures, may interfere with the accurate reading of the data. The chart's Y-axis labels are placed vertically, requiring readers to tilt their heads in order to read them, and the placement of food names on the X-axis requires more visual movement on the part of the user; these design issues may reduce the chart's perceptual efficiency.

| Can you tell me what you think this is?               	| Here's a bar graph comparing protein spend per 20g for meat, vegan and vegetarian foods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	| This is a graph showing the average cost of different proteins. The proteins are divided into meat, vegan,  and vegetarian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	|
| Can you describe to me what this is telling you?      	| It goes to show that most meat protein is more expensive than vegan and vegetarian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	| It tells me vegan and vegetarian proteins are cheaper than meat in general, but there are fewer options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|
| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?   	| I was thinking when I was looking at this picture, it seems that adults need to consume  roughly 50g of protein a day, so if I consume meat am I fine with a little bit of it, but  with plant-based foods I need to eat a lot of it because they don't contain the same amount  of protein. So if that's the case, it doesn't seem to follow that plant-based is more AFFORDABLE.              	| I am surprised that check legs, chicken breasts, and tuna are really cheap, actually. And they are more  affordable than extra-firm tofu. What I found confusing is the quantity. How do you measure 20g of proteins?  Is it 20g of the food? or is it 20g of proteins in the food? And How much protein does a regular person need in one day? 	|
| Who do you think is the intended audience for this?   	| Should the target audience be people who are conscious of their protein intake and at the same  time price concerned? But I think people who are very conscious of their protein intake might not  be such a price sensitive group, maybe also people who, for example, provide healthy public service  meals for children, similar public service organisations or policy makers.              	| The intended audience might be people who want to build muscles or are on a diet. They are looking for cheaper substitutes for their meal preparation since healthy, unprocessed food might be more expensive.                                                                                                                                  	|
| Is there anything you would change or do differently? 	| I think there is room for optimisation for some labels, such as 80/20 beef, which is a bit difficult  to understand the expression, as well as this label vertically, too small a bit not readable, the  text part of the feeling can be a bit larger, and then those few with a percentage of the beef  similar and difficult to understand the words, why not find a way to synthesise a bar? 	| I would change list out the 3 most common proteins in regular meal preparation in each category and compare their prices.  I would also make the title bigger.  I would change the data labels to images of the food maybe.                                                                                                                     	|

Another great piece of advice I got in the class critique was that all the bars are currently sorted inside their respective categories. Readers might also want to know the sorting by price along all foods.

Synthesis: 
Both respondents were able to understand that the charts show a comparison of the cost of protein in different types (meat, vegetarian, vegan) of food. They both mentioned that the chart shows the cost based on 20 grams of protein.
Both interviewees mentioned a possible misconception that although plant-based proteins are cheaper than meat proteins, they may not necessarily be more affordable in an actual diet because of the typically lower protein content in plant-based foods.
Both interviewees suggested optimising the label size of the charts to make them easier to read.
The first interviewee suggested that the target audience might include people who are sensitive to both protein intake and price, possibly organisations or policy makers who provide public health catering. The second interviewee, on the other hand, thought the target audience for the charts was muscle builders who were looking for healthy, economical meal options or those who were dieting.
My change plan:
<br />
Firstly, I will resize and orientate the data labels to make them more readable. I will also rewrite the chart titles so that they more accurately reflect the core of the chart.

I have decided against the suggestion of combining the data for beef with three different fat contents. I think the difference in fat content is an important piece of information for our target audience - fitness enthusiasts and dietitians - so it's important to keep those details. Additionally, with regard to the suggestion to replace the text labels with images of food, whilst this would add visual appeal, I chose to continue with the text labels given the potential for unclear messaging that could result.

I also received suggestions that the three commonly used sources of protein in each food group should be listed. However, I was unable to achieve this due to not being able to find a reliable enough data source to pinpoint the three most commonly consumed foods in each category. Finally, based on my classmate's suggestion in the in-class critique, I plan to explore a way to enhance the interactivity and informational value of the chart by not only displaying the sorting within each category, but also the overall price sorting of all the food items when necessary. This will allow users to customise the view to suit their needs, whether they are looking at comparisons within categories or an overall cost-benefit analysis.

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
