# Xiaohan's Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Xiaohan Liu (She/Her). <br/>
Iâ€™m passionate about data visualization and love experimenting with different types of charts to help the target audience gain valuable insights from the data. Iâ€™m also really into UI/UX design, and I enjoy focusing on the details to make sure the audience has the best and clearest experience. On top of that, Iâ€™m a big fan of creating interactive data visualizations, especially when I get to write the code myself. Iâ€™ve worked with JavaScript and Blazor to build real-time, interactive dashboards for the web.

# What I hope to learn

1. Design Principles
2. Tableau
3. PowerBI


# Portfolio
I'll update the section later in this course :)
