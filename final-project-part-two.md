# User research 

## Target audience
- Policymakers
  - Policymakers will be interested in the reasons for New Zealand's declining population and will want to know what the Māori's high fertility rate tells them.
- Māori people
  - My project explores the cultural, social and economic factors behind Māori fertility that resonate with their lives.
- Pākehā and Asians in New Zealand of childbearing age
  - Pākehā (European New Zealanders) and Asians in New Zealand are severely affected by declining fertility. They may be interested in learning how to cope with declining fertility rates and finding solutions that fit their ethnicity.
- Social service organisations
  - Social welfare agencies that provide services to families, women and children may be concerned about how to design more effective services to increase fertility in the reproductive age population. By understanding Māori community support systems and cultural identity, these agencies may be able to better serve families of all ethnicities.

## Interview script

| Interviewee 	| Question 	|
|---	|---	|
| Future Policymaker 	| Structural design: Do you think the overall structure of my storyboard is coherent? Are there any logical gaps, or are there sections that need more detail? 	|
| Future Policymaker 	| Content Relevance: In describing the impact of New Zealand's population decline and the differences in fertility rates by ethnicity, do you think I have effectively highlighted important policy-relevant points? Are there any policy or social contexts that you think should be discussed in more depth? 	|
| Future Policymaker 	| Data visualisation design: with regard to the part of the data visualisation I used, do you think the charts clearly communicate the data related to fertility? Are there certain charts that are not designed to be intuitive enough or may confuse the viewer? 	|
| Future Policymaker 	| Discussion of high Māori fertility: I discussed the reasons for high Māori fertility in storyboard. Do you think I have fully covered this topic? Are there any other relevant policy, historical or social factors that could be added? 	|
| Māori 	| Culture and family: In my storyboard I mentioned the phenomenon of higher Māori fertility rates. Do you think that the concepts of family and community that I mentioned do have an impact on this higher fertility rate? Have these ideas changed in modern society? 	|
| Māori 	| Policy support: To what extent do you feel that current policies in New Zealand (e.g. government benefits, housing subsidies, etc.) have an impact on the reproductive decisions of Māori families? Are these policies sufficiently supportive of Māori families, or is there room for policy improvement? 	|
| Māori 	| Perceptions of Low Fertility Ethnic Groups: In storyboard, I discussed the reasons why other ethnic groups have lower fertility rates. What do you, as a Māori student, think about the low fertility rates of these ethnic groups? Do you think the fertility decisions of these ethnic groups are significantly different from the fertility choices of Māori? 	|
| Māori 	| Considering the challenges faced by Māori in New Zealand society, how do you think Māori fertility trends are likely to change in the future? Do you think Māori society will adjust its fertility decisions in response to economic or policy changes? 	|
| Chinese expectant mother in NZ 	| Influence of cultural background on fertility decisions: As a Chinese mother-to-be, how do you think Chinese culture and traditions have influenced your fertility decisions in New Zealand? Do these cultural values conflict with or complement the dominant culture in New Zealand? 	|
| Chinese expectant mother in NZ 	| Policy support and demand: What are your views on the maternity benefits (e.g. maternity leave, childcare assistance, etc.) provided by the New Zealand Government to mothers-to-be? Do these policies meet your needs as a newcomer, or do you think there is room for improvement? 	|
| Chinese expectant mother in NZ 	| Thoughts on Low Fertility: In my storyboard, I discussed the phenomenon of lower fertility rates among other ethnic groups in New Zealand, such as Asians. What do you think is the reason for the lower fertility rate among Asians? Do factors such as culture, economy and work pressure play a role in your fertility decisions? 	|
| Chinese expectant mother in NZ 	| Future plans and expectations: As a soon-to-be mother, what are your expectations and concerns about your future family life and parenting in New Zealand? Do you think the social and policy environment in New Zealand will help you to realise these expectations? 	|


## Interview findings

### Future policymaker, a university student majoring in Public Policy
- Structural design: Do you think the overall structure of my storyboard is coherent? Are there any logical gaps, or are there sections that need more detail?
  - Falling birth rates -> Reasons for higher Maori birth rates -> Reasons for falling birth rates in New Zealand -> call to action, looking at it this way, the Māori section is a bit odd here, because according to the analysis, the reasons for the higher Māori birth rate are not replicable, so it doesn't feel quite as if Māori can be used as an inspiration to find a programme that works for everyone... Alternatively, this part needs a bit more explanation.
- Content Relevance: In describing the impact of New Zealand's population decline and the differences in fertility rates by ethnicity, do you think I have effectively highlighted important policy-relevant points? Are there any policy or social contexts that you think should be discussed in more depth?
  - I think the section on why the birth rate is low could be added to find a corresponding solution. I actually found the section on immigration, quite interesting, but said very little about it, and I doubt it would dovetail well with the economic factors that came before it.
- Data visualisation design: with regard to the part of the data visualisation I used, do you think the charts clearly communicate the data related to fertility? Are there certain charts that are not designed to be intuitive enough or may confuse the viewer?
  - Great, love where that graph zooms out to the average age!
- Discussion of high Māori fertility: I discussed the reasons for high Māori fertility in storyboard. Do you think I have fully covered this topic? Are there any other relevant policy, historical or social factors that could be added?
  - A comprehensive account of the reasons for high Māori fertility is given, but it is not certain that it will inform other policies.
- Other suggestions
  - Can you add a navigator that is always there, that is, you can always review, what this post is about and it's easy to go back if you want to. Can some important points be bolded or changed colour?

### A Māori university student, currently finishing his 3rd year of university
- Culture and family: In my storyboard I mentioned the phenomenon of higher Māori fertility rates. Do you think that the concepts of family and community that I mentioned do have an impact on this higher fertility rate? Have these ideas changed in modern society?
  - I like that you mentioned the concept of whakapapa. For us whānau (family) is also important. Not only do we look after our own children, but we also look after the children of other family members. The older members of the family have a lot of influence on the children's decision to have children and they do want them to have more children. Our concept of family has not changed much in the modern world.
- Policy support: To what extent do you feel that current policies in New Zealand (e.g. government benefits, housing subsidies, etc.) have an impact on the reproductive decisions of Māori families? Are these policies sufficiently supportive of Māori families, or is there room for policy improvement?
  - The Government does have welfare programmes for Maori, but I do not think they are quite enough. These policies are not sufficient to fully address the deep-seated socio-economic problems faced by Maori, such as our opportunity to get access to higher education.
- Perceptions of Low Fertility Ethnic Groups: In storyboard, I discussed the reasons why other ethnic groups have lower fertility rates. What do you, as a Māori student, think about the low fertility rates of these ethnic groups? Do you think the fertility decisions of these ethnic groups are significantly different from the fertility choices of Māori?
  - I think a lot of Pākehā and Asians delay having children perhaps based on economic and career advancement factors. I've heard people complain that the current economic situation in New Zealand makes it impossible for them to afford children, or that their jobs don't allow them to spend time with their children. Especially in Auckland, house prices are so high that we young people just can't afford it. Many Pākehā and Asians choose to send their kids to private school, which is expensive! The Maori kids I know tend to attend public schools.
- Considering the challenges faced by Māori in New Zealand society, how do you think Māori fertility trends are likely to change in the future? Do you think Māori society will adjust its fertility decisions in response to economic or policy changes?
  - Of course we want to hold on to our culture, but New Zealand is in an economic downturn right now and it's going to be harder and harder for young people to feed themselves. The high Maori fertility rate you described may be difficult to maintain for long unless the economy recovers.

### A Chinese mother-to-be who's a new immigrant to New Zealand
- Influence of cultural background on fertility decisions: As a Chinese mother-to-be, how do you think Chinese culture and traditions have influenced your fertility decisions in New Zealand? Do these cultural values conflict with or complement the dominant culture in New Zealand?
  - I actually don't quite agree with the traditional idea that Chinese people must pass on their heritage, and I don't think having children should be too purposeful. After living in New Zealand, I have become more accepting of the concept of freedom and personal choice as the centre of fertility here.
- Policy support and demand: What are your views on the maternity benefits (e.g. maternity leave, childcare assistance, etc.) provided by the New Zealand Government to mothers-to-be? Do these policies meet your needs as a newcomer, or do you think there is room for improvement?
  - I think the maternity benefits provided by the New Zealand government are generally good in supporting mothers-to-be, especially for new immigrants like me, and it does relieve a lot of stress to be able to enjoy the same policy coverage. However, I think there is still room for improvement in some areas, such as the length of maternity leave could be increased a little bit, especially for dual-income families like us.
- Thoughts on Low Fertility: In my storyboard, I discussed the phenomenon of lower fertility rates among other ethnic groups in New Zealand, such as Asians. What do you think is the reason for the lower fertility rate among Asians? Do factors such as culture, economy and work pressure play a role in your fertility decisions?
  - I believe that the low fertility rate in the Asian community may be the result of a combination of factors. Culturally, many Asian families place a premium on education and career development, and many women will choose to delay having children or even have fewer children in order to focus on their careers. Economically, the high cost of living, especially in big cities, increases the burden of childcare and discourages many families from having more children. In addition, work pressure is also an important factor, and many new Asian immigrants prioritise career stability and finances in order to gain a foothold in New Zealand, thus delaying childbearing decisions.
- Future plans and expectations: As a soon-to-be mother, what are your expectations and concerns about your future family life and parenting in New Zealand? Do you think the social and policy environment in New Zealand will help you to realise these expectations?
  - As a mum-to-be, I am looking forward to my future family life and hope to give my child a good upbringing in a country like New Zealand where the environment is beautiful and the pace of life is more balanced. My biggest concern is the quality of education in New Zealand.


# Identified changes for Part III



| Research synthesiss | Anticipated changes for Part IIIs |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------|
| The Māori component needs more explanation and cannot be used solely as a reference for fertility policy.             The uniqueness of Māori fertility needs to be clearly stated.          |
| A discussion of low fertility could include corresponding solutions.                  | | After explaining the causes of low fertility, add potential policy solutions or recommendations to complete the logical closure and echo Call to Action. | | Add a discussion of the impact of migration.
| Add a discussion of the impact of immigration, especially the impact of immigration on economic factors.            | | Extend the discussion of the impact of migration on fertility choices and further analyse the link between economic pressures on migrants and fertility.                                              | | | | | | | | | | | |
| | The data visualisation section is generally good, but could be focused and navigation added.        | | Emphasis on key data points, possibly by highlighting important data through colour or bolding, adding always-visible navigation features to make it easier for readers to jump back to key sections.                 |
| Insufficient support for Māori in current policy, suggest adding discussion of education and housing.     | | Add a critical discussion of current policies, particularly how education and housing affect Māori's reproductive choices, and suggest specific policy improvements.                  |
