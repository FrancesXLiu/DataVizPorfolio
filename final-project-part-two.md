# User research 

## Target audience
- Policymakers
  - Policymakers will be interested in the reasons for New Zealand's declining population and will want to know what the Māori's high fertility rate tells them.
- Māori people
  - My project explores the cultural, social and economic factors behind Māori fertility that resonate with their lives.
- Pākehā and Asians in New Zealand of childbearing age
  - Pākehā (European New Zealanders) and Asians in New Zealand are severely affected by declining fertility. They may be interested in learning how to cope with declining fertility rates and finding solutions that fit their ethnicity.
- Social service organisations
  - Social welfare agencies that provide services to families, women and children may be concerned about how to design more effective services to increase fertility in the reproductive age population. By understanding Māori community support systems and cultural identity, these agencies may be able to better serve families of all ethnicities.

## Interview script

| Interviewee 	| Question 	|
|---	|---	|
| Future Policymaker 	| Structural design: Do you think the overall structure of my storyboard is coherent? Are there any logical gaps, or are there sections that need more detail? 	|
| Future Policymaker 	| Content Relevance: In describing the impact of New Zealand's population decline and the differences in fertility rates by ethnicity, do you think I have effectively highlighted important policy-relevant points? Are there any policy or social contexts that you think should be discussed in more depth? 	|
| Future Policymaker 	| Data visualisation design: with regard to the part of the data visualisation I used, do you think the charts clearly communicate the data related to fertility? Are there certain charts that are not designed to be intuitive enough or may confuse the viewer? 	|
| Future Policymaker 	| Discussion of high Māori fertility: I discussed the reasons for high Māori fertility in storyboard. Do you think I have fully covered this topic? Are there any other relevant policy, historical or social factors that could be added? 	|
| Māori 	| Culture and family: In my storyboard I mentioned the phenomenon of higher Māori fertility rates. Do you think that the concepts of family and community that I mentioned do have an impact on this higher fertility rate? Have these ideas changed in modern society? 	|
| Māori 	| Policy support: To what extent do you feel that current policies in New Zealand (e.g. government benefits, housing subsidies, etc.) have an impact on the reproductive decisions of Māori families? Are these policies sufficiently supportive of Māori families, or is there room for policy improvement? 	|
| Māori 	| Perceptions of Low Fertility Ethnic Groups: In storyboard, I discussed the reasons why other ethnic groups have lower fertility rates. What do you, as a Māori student, think about the low fertility rates of these ethnic groups? Do you think the fertility decisions of these ethnic groups are significantly different from the fertility choices of Māori? 	|
| Māori 	| Considering the challenges faced by Māori in New Zealand society, how do you think Māori fertility trends are likely to change in the future? Do you think Māori society will adjust its fertility decisions in response to economic or policy changes? 	|
| Chinese expectant mother in NZ 	| Influence of cultural background on fertility decisions: As a Chinese mother-to-be, how do you think Chinese culture and traditions have influenced your fertility decisions in New Zealand? Do these cultural values conflict with or complement the dominant culture in New Zealand? 	|
| Chinese expectant mother in NZ 	| Policy support and demand: What are your views on the maternity benefits (e.g. maternity leave, childcare assistance, etc.) provided by the New Zealand Government to mothers-to-be? Do these policies meet your needs as a newcomer, or do you think there is room for improvement? 	|
| Chinese expectant mother in NZ 	| Thoughts on Low Fertility: In my storyboard, I discussed the phenomenon of lower fertility rates among other ethnic groups in New Zealand, such as Asians. What do you think is the reason for the lower fertility rate among Asians? Do factors such as culture, economy and work pressure play a role in your fertility decisions? 	|
| Chinese expectant mother in NZ 	| Future plans and expectations: As a soon-to-be mother, what are your expectations and concerns about your future family life and parenting in New Zealand? Do you think the social and policy environment in New Zealand will help you to realise these expectations? 	|
