# Changes made since Part II

1. Adjusting for the relationship between fertility and the degree of economic development
Initially, I attempted to explain low national fertility by the difference in fertility between economically developed and underdeveloped regions within New Zealand, but found that this comparison did not fully explain the overall fertility decline in New Zealand. To address this issue, I rearranged the 2023 GDP and fertility data for each region of New Zealand and found through visualisation that, with the exception of Auckland, regions with high GDP generally have lower fertility rates. This trend is consistent with low fertility in developed countries globally. I therefore combine these observations to make a new argument: more economically advanced regions tend to be accompanied by lower fertility. 
2. Partial deletion of immigrant fertility
In user research feedback, I found that the use of immigrant fertility rates to explain New Zealand's low overall fertility rates was not well justified. Whilst there may be some correlation between immigration and fertility, there is a lack of direct causal data to support this. In addition, I also did not find enough specific data on the impact of out-migration on fertility, especially on whether migrants leaving New Zealand are of childbearing age or not. Therefore, in order to avoid far-fetched and incomplete inferences, I decided to remove the section on migrant fertility altogether to ensure the rigour of the analysis.
3. Reduction of text
I realised that some of the text was too long, especially when explaining the reasons for the decline in fertility, and that the density of information in the text was too high, which could easily make the reader lose patience. To improve readability, I shortened long paragraphs and used bullet points to simplify information delivery. 
4. Adding Call to Action

## The audience
In Part 3 I did not make changes to my target audience. My target audience groups are:
- Policymakers: I targeted policymakers as a target audience because they are interested in New Zealand's demographic trends and are in a position to develop relevant policies to address declining fertility. In my interview, I had an in-depth discussion with a future policymaker. She provided valuable feedback on my storyboards from both a policy and social support perspective, allowing me to better integrate these factors into my presentation of fertility issues.
- Māori people: Māori people are another important target audience for me as my version of the story analyses the cultural, social and economic factors associated with Māori fertility. I interviewed a Māori male university student who provided some insight into the influence of family and community on fertility decisions. However, I realised that if I had been able to interview a Māori female, her feedback may have been more in-depth, particularly in relation to women's fertility decisions, but due to time constraints I was unable to do so.
- Pākehā (Europeans) and other ethnic groups in New Zealand of childbearing age: Pākehā and other ethnic groups of childbearing age are similarly my target audience as they are facing the direct effects of declining fertility. I interviewed an Asian mum-to-be about the quality of education and the cost of childcare in New Zealand, and in particular how these factors affected her decision-making about childbearing. Her feedback made me realise that apart from economic factors, the quality of education is also an important variable in influencing fertility, so I included an elaboration on this point in Part 3.
- Social service organisations: Social service organisations, as agencies that provide support to families, women and children, are one of my target audiences as they can increase fertility rates through more effective services. I was not able to interview the staff of social service organisations due to a lack of contacts from the people involved.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

## References
In the Changes made since Part II section, I've discussed changes to the content and analysis. I will focus on the visualisation design decisions I made in this part.
I decided to use red, black and white as the theme colours for the project, these are the national colours of the Maori people and the Maori version of the New Zealand flag is made up of these three colours. Black As the background and main colour for the storyboard, as black symbolises strength and respect in Māori culture and is also closely associated with Māori traditions. Red As the highlight colour, it is used primarily to highlight important information, as it contrasts with black, and because red symbolises vitality and energy in Māori culture, it also makes key data more visible.

For the colour scheme of the map, I chose to avoid the use of red and black. Although these colours are the thematic colours of the project, the use of red to mark areas on the map could send a message of ‘warning’ or ‘danger’, which is not what I wanted to convey. I didn't want to directly associate ‘low fertility’ with a negative connotation, so I chose the more neutral colours of blue and orange to represent fertility rates in different areas.


# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
