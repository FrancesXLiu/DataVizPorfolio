# Changes made since Part II

1. Adjusting for the relationship between fertility and the degree of economic development
Initially, I attempted to explain low national fertility by the difference in fertility between economically developed and underdeveloped regions within New Zealand, but found that this comparison did not fully explain the overall fertility decline in New Zealand. To address this issue, I rearranged the 2023 GDP and fertility data for each region of New Zealand and found through visualisation that, with the exception of Auckland, regions with high GDP generally have lower fertility rates. This trend is consistent with low fertility in developed countries globally. I therefore combine these observations to make a new argument: more economically advanced regions tend to be accompanied by lower fertility. 
2. Partial deletion of immigrant fertility
In user research feedback, I found that the use of immigrant fertility rates to explain New Zealand's low overall fertility rates was not well justified. Whilst there may be some correlation between immigration and fertility, there is a lack of direct causal data to support this. In addition, I also did not find enough specific data on the impact of out-migration on fertility, especially on whether migrants leaving New Zealand are of childbearing age or not. Therefore, in order to avoid far-fetched and incomplete inferences, I decided to remove the section on migrant fertility altogether to ensure the rigour of the analysis.
3. Reduction of text
I realised that some of the text was too long, especially when explaining the reasons for the decline in fertility, and that the density of information in the text was too high, which could easily make the reader lose patience. To improve readability, I shortened long paragraphs and used bullet points to simplify information delivery. 
4. Adding Call to Action

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
